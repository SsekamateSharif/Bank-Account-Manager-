# Bank-Account-Manager-
A simple python application for running bank account management programmes. 
My project is a simple bank management application.
I created it using Object Oriented Programming with python. 
It has two files one contains the class for the bank accounts and the other contains the instances for the bank accounts. 
A user can create a bank account, 
Deposit money to that account, 
withdraw money from that account,
transfer money from that account 
and  can also display the accounts information.
All my code files are in the master file of this GitHub repository.
