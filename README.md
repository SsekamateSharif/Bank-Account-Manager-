# Bank-Account-Manager-
A simple python application for running bank account management programmes 
My project is a simple bank management application
I created it using Object Oriented Programming with python 
It has two files one contains the class for the bank accounts and the other contains the instances for the bank accounts 
A user can create a bank account 
Deposit money to that account 
withdraw money from that account 
And also can transfer money from that account 
And can also display the accounts information
